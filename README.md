# Kanagawa GTK theme for Discord
this is just the theme I use, It's only on github so I can load it easier

download theme.css and plop it into your themes floder for BD

Also, just to clarify, you can open an issue on this if you would like to suggest changes, I'm fine with adding them.
Just because this is a theme I made for myself doesn't mean it's not open to change :)

on vencord, just copy the raw link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ardishco-the-great/KanagawaGTK-for-discord/main/theme.css and put it in your theme section


I have no idea about replugged, sorry.
# Changing the font
If you want to change the font for whatever reason, make a repo (or use an existing one) and upload any sort of font.
After you've done that, click on it and copy the raw link and replace the links under where it says ``Here is the font change``

(rounded corners and border colours not included, that's a Linux thing.)
(sometimes minor tweaks like colour changes may not be reflected immediately onto the preview screenshots so feel free to let me know in the issues if this is the case.)
