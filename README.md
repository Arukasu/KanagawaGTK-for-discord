# Kanagawa GTK theme for Discord
this is just the theme I use, It's only on github so I can load it easier

download theme.css and plop it into your themes floder for BD

on vencord, just copy the raw link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ardishco-the-great/KanagawaGTK-for-discord/main/theme.css and put it in your theme section


I have no idea about replugged, sorry.
# Changing the font
If you want to change the font for whatever reason, make a repo (or use an existing one) and upload any sort of font.
After you've done that, click on it and copy the raw link and replace the links under where it says ``Here is the font change``
